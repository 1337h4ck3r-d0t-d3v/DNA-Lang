# DNA-Lang: The Genetic Programming Language

🧬 **DNA-Lang** is a revolutionary programming language that treats code as living organisms with genetic traits, evolution capabilities, and AI agent collaboration built-in.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Create Your First Organism

```bash
# Create a new organism
node dist/cli.js new MyApp

# Compile to TypeScript
node dist/cli.js compile MyApp.dna

# Run the living organism
node dist/cli.js run MyApp.dna
```

## 🧬 Language Features

### 1. **Organism Definition**

Define living software organisms with DNA, genome, and agent collaborations:

```dna
organism ECommerceApp {
    dna {
        domain: "ecommerce"
        scale: "enterprise"
        security_level: "high"
        evolution_rate: "adaptive"
        immune_system: enabled
    }

    genome {
        trait performance_optimized: always_active
        trait security_hardened: paranoid_mode
        trait user_experience: delightful
    }

    agents {
        architect: ArchitectAgent(focus: microservices)
        security: SecurityAgent(vigilance: maximum)
        developer: DeveloperAgent(speed: fast)
    }
}
```

### 2. **Agent Collaboration**

Define how AI agents collaborate to build features:

```dna
collaboration BuildPaymentFlow {
    participants: ["architect", "security", "developer"]
    workflow: [
        "architect.design_flow",
        "security.validate_design",
        "developer.implement",
        "security.audit"
    ]
    conflict_resolution: {
        security_vs_speed: prioritize_security,
        complexity_vs_simplicity: favor_simplicity
    }
}
```

### 3. **Gene Definition** (Coming Soon)

Define genetic code that can evolve and self-optimize:

```dna
gene DatabaseQuery {
    purpose: "High-performance database operations"
    security_level: critical

    implementation: {
        strategy: connection_pooling,
        code: "async function query(sql) { /* implementation */ }"
    }

    mutations: {
        optimize_performance: {
            methods: ["indexing", "caching", "query_rewriting"],
            target: "response_time < 50ms"
        }
    }

    immune_responses: {
        sql_injection: "sanitize_and_block",
        slow_query: "optimize_automatically"
    }
}
```

## 💻 Generated Output

DNA-Lang transpiles to:

1. **TypeScript Code** - Living organism classes with evolution and self-healing
2. **Agent Configurations** - JSON configs for AI agent coordination
3. **Metadata** - Organism DNA, capabilities, and collaboration rules

### Example Generated TypeScript

```typescript
export class ECommerceApp implements OrganismInterface {
  public readonly dna: DNAConfig = {
    domain: "ecommerce",
    scale: "enterprise",
    security_level: "high",
    evolution_rate: "adaptive",
    immune_system: true
  };

  public readonly agents = new Map<string, AgentInterface>();

  constructor() {
    this.initializeAgents();
    this.startEvolutionLoop();
  }

  public async evolve(): Promise<void> {
    console.log("🧬 ECommerceApp is evolving...");
    await this.performanceOptimized();
    await this.securityHardened();
    await this.userExperience();
  }

  public async selfHeal(): Promise<void> {
    if (this.dna.immune_system) {
      console.log("🛡️ ECommerceApp immune system activating...");
      // Self-healing logic here
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. **Multi-Agent Development**

- Coordinate architect, developer, security, and QA agents
- Automated code review and optimization workflows
- Conflict resolution between competing priorities

### 2. **Self-Evolving Applications**

- Applications that improve performance over time
- Automatic security patching and hardening
- Adaptive user experience optimization

### 3. **Enterprise Integration**

- Living APIs that evolve with usage patterns
- Self-healing microservices
- Genetic compliance and governance

## 🧪 Examples

### Basic Organism

```bash
node dist/cli.js compile examples/simple-test.dna
```

### E-Commerce App (Work in Progress)

```bash

**DNA-Lang: Where Code Becomes Life** 🧬✨

## Experimental: ANTLR Grammar & Nested Block Support

### Parser Refinement (In Progress)

- The DNA-Lang parser is being upgraded to support deeper/nested block structures (e.g., blocks within blocks for mutations, implementation, etc.).
- This will allow for more expressive DNA-Lang constructs and future extensibility.

### ANTLR Grammar Branch (Experimental)

- An experimental branch is being created to explore using [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) for DNA-Lang parsing.
- ANTLR grammar files will be placed in a new directory: `src/antlr/`.
- This branch will not disrupt mainline progress and will be used for research and prototyping a robust grammar.

### How to Contribute/Experiment

- To try the ANTLR grammar, see `src/antlr/DNALang.g4` (to be created).
- Contributions to both the hand-written parser and the ANTLR grammar are welcome.
