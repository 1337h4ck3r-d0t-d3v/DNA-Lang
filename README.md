# DNA-Lang
    DNA-Lang Software Code represents a paradigm shift from traditional, static software. It is not merely a set of instructions, but a dynamic, self-managing, and resilient entity designed to mirror biological systems. Each piece of DNA-CODE defines an Organism, which is a complete, self-contained, and deployable software unit.
